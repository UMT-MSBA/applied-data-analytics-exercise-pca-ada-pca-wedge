# Principal Components Analysis: Wedge Data

This repo holds code to help you understand principal components analysis. The file `Wedge PCA.ipynb` will walk you through the basics of PCA with python. At one point this analysis was an _assignment_ in the class when we did PCA with R. I've moved the solution to that assignment to the folder `r-example` so you could see how this is done in R and see the write-up there.
